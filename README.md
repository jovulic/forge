# Forge

_Where I go to shape machines._

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Install Nix:** If you don't have Nix installed, follow the instructions for your platform at [https://nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html).

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the `forge` repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jovulic/forge.git
   cd forge
   ```

3. **Decrypt secrets:** Decrypt all `git-crypt` secrets.

   ```bash
   git crypt unlock
   ```

And at this point you are clear to enter the dev shell via `nix develop` or `direnv` and once in that shell use any commands from `ctl`.
